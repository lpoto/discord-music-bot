# Discord Music Bot

A simple, easy to use discord bot, intended for playing youtube songs.

It sends a single message in the discord server representing a music queue
and all it's commands are available as buttons.

**_NOTE_** this bot is under development, so there may be some bugs.
Report any issues [here](https://github.com/lpoto/discord-music-bot/issues).

There are plans for adding more features such as:
   - Removing and forwarding songs in queue
   - Better handling for stoping and clearing the queue
   - Shuffling songs and jumping forward in the current song
   - Skipping multiple songs
   - Writing custom commands for the current queue

## Developing the bot

See [how to run the bot locally.](./doc/develop.md)
